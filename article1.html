    <h3>Hey !</h3>
    <h3>Thanks for clicking on my first blog post! </h3>
    <h3>Before anything, let me introduce myself. I'm ** years old - you'll discover my age later in time if you follow me during my journey -, I love coding and studying - even though I have struggled a lot -. It's my first blog, so, if possible, please go to the <a href="support.html"><button style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font: 700;">support</button></a> section and make a little donation so I can improve.  In my life, I'm also a student, very sociable and... all this boring stuff - except if you wanna know? -. </h3>
    <h3>You can come to my blog if you're facing studying difficulties, but also if you're very "lazy" and that you want to - finally - get to work! Here, I am gonna present to you my studying techniques, ways to learn and more - btw if you want a post on a specific subject, you can e-mail me on the <a href="contact.html"><button style="background-color: white; border: 0px; font-family: 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; font: 700;">contact</button></a>section.

    <h3>You can also contact me if you have any complaints, disagreements or even suggestions. I'll do my best to resolve your situation. You can contact me at any time, but I usually respond only on Wednesdays and weekends.</h3>
    <h3>Lots of people are like “Omg studies look so easy I’m gonna nail it” but once they’re into it they completely change their mind. But do you really need to study supeeerrrrrr harrrrrrdddd to get good grades ? You’ll also discover this later. </h3>
